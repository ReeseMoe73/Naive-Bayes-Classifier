# Naive-Bayes-Classifier
A compact, didactic implementation of a Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifier that predicts a movie’s genre from simple binary attributes (e.g., “contains_humor”, “is_futuristic”). The script is intentionally minimal to foreground core concepts: feature encoding, model training, and single-example inference.
